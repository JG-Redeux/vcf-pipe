MissingOutputException in line 26 of /home/jgd/vcf-pipe/Snakefile:
Job Missing files after 5 seconds:
output/NIST2_proc.vcf
This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait.
Job id: 0 completed successfully, but some output files are missing. 0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
